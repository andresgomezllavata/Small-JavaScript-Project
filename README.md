Some years ago, I was asked to perform a small JavaScript project for a job interview. 
The requirement was as simple as that: 'Please, develop a small JavaScript project, so we can show it to the client.'

After a quick Google search, I came up with this idea of an on-screen keyboard with a 'SEND' button, that actually sended the email to whichever email address you typed in.


Two observations:
* The CSS layout was copyed from a public repository.
* For the server, I used [Elastic Email](https://elasticemail.com/). It is not currently up, because the free trial period ended up already.



Thanks for reading. By the way, I did get the job!
